# IoT-Guard
<p>
<b>Implementation environment</b>
  
In this section we deal about the usage of laptop
and ESP8266 environment on which we
performed our implementation.<br>
Laptop:<br>
The current scheme is implemented on a Windows
11 computer with an Intel 64-bit Core i5 processor
running at 4.5 GHz and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM,
as well as Python Flask (python3) as the software
configuration. We built one blockchain server,
one cluster header, and one IoT device as part of
our implementation of the entire process.<br>
ESP8266:<br>
ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full
TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capabilities,
designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
ESP8266 can be used as a standalone
microcontroller or as a Wi-Fi module for other
microcontrollers, making it a popular choice for
DIY electronics projects. It supports various
communication protocols, such as HTTP, MQTT,
and WebSocket, and can be programmed using the
Arduino IDE or other programming languages
such as MicroPython and Lua. The chip is
available in different variations, such as ESP-01,
ESP-12, and ESP-32, each with different pin
configurations, memory, and features. ESP-01 is
the smallest and cheapest version with limited
GPIO pins, while ESP-32 is a more powerful and
feature-rich variant with dual-core processor,
more GPIO pins, and support for Bluetooth and
BLE.
